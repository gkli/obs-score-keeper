# obs-score-keeper

Desktop application that tracks game clock & score and reflects its values into a set of text files.

In OBS, add your scoreboard graphics as well as the following text fields:
1. Game Clock: point it to a text file that Score Keeper will write to 
   * (score keeper config allows you to configure the file location)
2. Game Score: point it to a text file that Score Keeper will write to 
   * (score keeper config allows you to configure the file location)
3. If you wish to use a "Goal" graphic, add an image src pointing to location of an image - note this image will be created/deleted by the Score Keeper, so make sure to use an image in a location where it will be ok for it to be deleted and recreated
